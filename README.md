Overview
Welcome to the Delivery Food Services API, an innovative solution designed for modern food delivery services. This project harnesses the power of Java Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Java 11, and REST APIs to create a robust and scalable platform. Whether you're a developer interested in backend services, a student learning modern Java development practices, or a business looking to understand the technical aspects of a food delivery service, this repository offers valuable insights and practical implementations.

**Technology Stack**

**Java 11**: As the backbone of our application, Java 11 provides improved performance, stability, and security. It brings the latest features in Java development, ensuring our codebase is up-to-date and efficient.

**Spring Boot**: This powerful framework simplifies the bootstrapping and development of new Spring applications. Its auto-configuration, standalone code, and opinionated approach to configuration make it a perfect fit for rapidly developing microservices.

**Spring Data JPA**: Handling database operations is a breeze with Spring Data JPA. It reduces the amount of boilerplate code required, making data access layers more manageable and streamlining database interactions with its advanced data modeling capabilities.

**REST API**: Exposing our functionalities through RESTful services ensures that our application is flexible, scalable, and easy to integrate with various front-end technologies or third-party services.

**Features**

**Efficient Request Handling**: Our API efficiently handles requests, ensuring high performance even during peak load times.

**Scalable Architecture**: Designed with scalability in mind, our system can accommodate growing user numbers and increased data volume effortlessly.

**Security and Reliability**: We prioritize security and reliability, implementing best practices to safeguard data and ensure system stability.
